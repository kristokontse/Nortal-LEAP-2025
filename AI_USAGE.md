# AI Usage

Briefly describe how you used AI (tools, prompts, code snippets, fixes). Be concise and honest (using AI is fine; it's just a tool; we want to know your method). If you did not use AI, state that here.


I primarily used AI to analyze error codes and to help me identify which parts of the code were faulty and suggesting potential fixes. I also used AI to refactor my code at the end for improved efficiency and readability where appropriate. I always double-checked the fixes that AI provided and used the solutions if needed. Additionally, whenever I didn’t fully understand a piece of code, I used AI to provide examples of its behavior and expected output. I mainly used ChatGpt and Github Copilot.
